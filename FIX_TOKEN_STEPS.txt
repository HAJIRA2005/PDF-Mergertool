QUICK FIX - Get New Token with Workflow Permission
========================================

STEP 1: Create New Token
------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
4. Name it: "PDF Merger Tool"
5. Check BOTH boxes:
   ✅ repo (all repo permissions)
   ✅ workflow (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. COPY THE NEW TOKEN (starts with ghp_)


STEP 2: Push Again
------------------------
After you get the new token, come back here and paste it.
I'll push your code for you!


WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------------
Your project has GitHub Actions workflow files (.github/workflows/)
GitHub needs special permission to upload those files.
That's why we need the "workflow" permission!
