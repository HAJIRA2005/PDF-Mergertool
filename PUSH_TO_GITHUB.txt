HOW TO PUSH TO GITHUB - SUPER SIMPLE!
========================================

STEP 1: Get a Token (Special Password)
----------------------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Click "Generate new token"
4. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Name it: "PDF Merger Tool"
6. Check the box that says "repo" (all repo permissions)
7. Scroll down and click "Generate token"
8. COPY THE LONG CODE IT SHOWS YOU (starts with ghp_)
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Copy it NOW - you can only see it once!


STEP 2: Push Your Code
----------------------------------------
1. Open PowerShell in your folder
2. Run this command:
   git push -u origin main

3. When it asks for Username:
   Type: HAJIRA2005
   Press Enter

4. When it asks for Password:
   PASTE YOUR TOKEN (the code you copied in Step 1)
   Press Enter

5. Wait... it should work!


STEP 3: Check It Worked
----------------------------------------
Go to: https://github.com/HAJIRA2005/pdf-merger-tool

You should see all your files there! 🎉


TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------
If it says "authentication failed":
- Make sure you used the TOKEN, not your real password
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE token (it's very long!)
- Try making a new token

If it says "repository not found":
- Make sure the repository exists at: https://github.com/HAJIRA2005/pdf-merger-tool
- Check that you're logged into the right GitHub account
